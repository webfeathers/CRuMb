The back end is driven by cakephp.\r\n\r\nCakePHP is not included in this repo, but will need to be checked out and placed at the same level as the web app. For example:\r\n* /usr/www/CRuMb/myapp\r\n* /usr/www/CRuMb/cakephp\r\n\r\nThen, your webserver needs to point the document root to:\r\n\r\n`/usr/www/CRuMb/myapp/webroot`\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@webfeathers\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
